# PPE Compliance Monitoring Toolkit

This repository contains a toolkit for monitoring Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance using computer vision and machine learning models.

## Project Overview

The toolkit leverages computer vision and deep learning to ensure that workers in the food industry are wearing the necessary PPE. The model is designed to detect whether the required PPE is being worn in various work environments, helping to enhance safety and regulatory compliance.

## Files Included

- **app.py**: The main application file that runs the PPE compliance monitoring system.
- **requirements.txt**: This contains necessary dependencies.
- **my_model.pt**: A trained PyTorch model for PPE detection.
- **logo.png**: Logo image for the toolkit.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/M-Muddassir-Saleem/PPE-Compliance-Monitoring.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
